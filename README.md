# State Farm Weather app

Our react-native mobile app displays location-based weather data and uses a trained machine learning algorithm to analyze the severity of a car crash given the data and identifies driver precautions. Our app uses a machine learning model derived from the Statefarm-supplied crash data to analyze real time weather data streaming from a user's device and inform them of the possible severity of a crash. It then displays factors to watch out for in order to decrease that severity if the severity met a certain threshold.
